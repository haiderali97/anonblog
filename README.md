# AnonBlog

A blog website written in PHP using the Laravel framework for the backend, and VueJS for the front end. Very simplistic, this only exists due to my boredom and lack of ideas.
Users are able to upvote, comment and write blog posts anonymously.

Inspired from websites such as fmylife and devrant, however not as complex.
